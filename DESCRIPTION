Description: 
    The 'mycount' package provides an easy-to-use function 'count_bio()' 
    for summarizing grouped data, extending the concept of 'dplyr::count()' 
    with additional features tailored to biostatistics and epidemiological analysis.
    It allows users to not only count observations or weighted events, 
    but also compute incidence rates (events per person-time) 
    and exact Poisson (Garwood) confidence intervals — commonly used 
    in cohort and clinical trial studies.
